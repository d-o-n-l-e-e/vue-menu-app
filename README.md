# Vue Menu App

This is a very basic app using Firebase and Vue. The app allows you to create users and then allows users mangage menus using live data. Users can also view menus from other users, but they can only update their own menu.

Note: this is is form demo purposes only.

```bash
# Start a dev server
npm run dev
```
